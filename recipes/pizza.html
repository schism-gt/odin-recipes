        <p>Pizza Margherita, also known as Margherita pizza,[1] is a typical Neapolitan pizza, roundish in shape with a raised edge (the cornicione) and garnished with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, mozzarella (buffalo mozzarella or fior di latte), fresh basil leaves, and extra virgin olive oil.[2][3] The dough is made by mixing water, salt, and yeast (either sourdough, or fresh or dry baker's yeast) with flour (00 or 0).[3]</p>

    <h2>How to make Pizza Margherita</h2>
        <p>Inspired by the pizza at Bar Del Corso, this Pizza Margherita features tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, with just a hint of sea salt. The following is for 4 servings:</p>

    <h2>Pizza Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast.</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar.</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour for dusting.</li>
        <li>2 cups pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>20 leaves fresh basil.</li>
        <li>Olive oil.</li>
        <li>Sea salt to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Pizza Margherita Step-By-Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
        <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
